| Known problems | You need live target and sometimes it is not public. So you might need an agent inside your network to do this.                                        |

HTTP headers play a vital role in securing web applications. Scanning these headers can uncover missing or misconfigured security directives — such as `Content-Security-Policy` or `Strict-Transport-Security` — that help defend against attacks like clickjacking and cross-site scripting. By using tools like `MDN HTTP Observatory`, you can quickly assess your site’s HTTP security posture, identify weaknesses, and implement fixes before a vulnerability becomes critical.

Good tools for this task are:

Online:

- Mozilla Observatory: <https://github.com/mdn/mdn-http-observatory/>
- Securityheaders: <https://securityheaders.com/>

Offline:

- OWASP Secure Headers Project validator (using venom): <https://github.com/oshp/oshp-validator>
  - If you use venom, the [`release/examples` branch `scripts`](https://github.com/Rinorragi/ci-security/blob/release/examples/scripts/oshp_validator_tests_suite.yml) folder has the yml file you'll need for calling the tool.

## Scan HTTP headers

In this lab, you’ll set up a workflow to scan the HTTP headers of your web application using `MDN HTTP Observatory`. You can ask for a target if you don't have one. This is not something that would be very intrusive. You can also try `OSHP validator` and running the target in docker. Check the [vulnerable-pipeline](/.github/workflows/vulnerable-pipeline.yml) to see how to run the app in docker.
